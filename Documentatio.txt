I was sorting the posts like this when fetching the data 
** const data = await getData() as Post[];
  console.log(data)
  return data.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date < b.date) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }); ** which essentailly a bad practice because i am sorting all the posts after fetching
  which seems inefficient because there can be 1000s of posts that needs to be sorted
  instead i modified my sanity query to provide sorted post data.

  changed query from     
  const query = '*[_type == "post"]'; to this

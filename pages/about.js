        Hey there! I'm <strong>Je</strong>, a software engineer who enjoys creating things. I'm all about crafting apps that are simple, efficient, and just plain awesome.

        I'm not a fan of flashy graphics or complicated websites. I prefer to keep things clean and minimal while ensuring they're enjoyable to use. Imagine it as making cool stuff without the unnecessary complexity.

        When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I'm exploring the intriguing realm of quantum mechanics. I'm also thrilled about the concept of <strong>web3</strong> and <strong>decentralization</strong>. I'm on a journey to grasp the fundamentals of web3, which promises a world of exciting possibilities.

        In a world filled with <i><strong>complexity</strong></i>, I prioritize <i><strong>simplicity</strong></i>, <i><strong>efficiency</strong></i> and <i>scalability</i> (lies,that is something I'm still learning). Join me on this adventure as we create fantastic apps that are user-friendly and clever. Feel free to reach out to me on <a href='https://twitter.com/saurabhjesingh'>Twitter</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhje/'>LinkedIn</a>.
